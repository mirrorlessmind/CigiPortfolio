## Progress Made

```
Added projects from the past couple of weeks. Removed placeholder projects. These projects demonstrate the newer skills aquired with the lessons in JQuery, Moment.JS, Bootstrap, advanced HTML & CSS. 
```


## Future Additions

Using current languages and ones in the near future, I will re-style with background animations and more interactive buttons.
